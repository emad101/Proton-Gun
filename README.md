# Proton-Gun
 A visual representation of how particles are effected   by the magnetic field generated by two oppositely charged plates <br/><br/>
 Use the radius slider to change the distance between plates <br/>
 Use the voltage slider to change the voltage of the battry <br/>
 Use the toggle to switch single partcile mode and multiple particle mode <br/>
 SLiders and Toggle are bugy when camera is moved <br/>
 Use the sliders and toggle only when camera is in natural <br/><br/>
 Controles:<br/>
 -Left mouse button -Add Electron(s)<br/>
 -Right mouse button - Add Proton(s)<br/>
 Middle mouse button - Change direction of electric filed <br/>
 Arrow keys - Move camera <br/>
 Mouse Wheel - Zoom In/Out <br/>
 SpaceBar - Reset camera <br/><br/>
 Note: <br/>
 Particles do not intract with each other <br/>
 Changes of particles have been normalized to "1" and "-1"<br/>
 Masses for protons nad electrons have been normalized to "1" and "50" respetively
